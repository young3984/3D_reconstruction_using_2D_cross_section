# 3D reconstruction using 2D cross_section(2020/12~2021/03)
- Reconstructing a 2D cross section into 3D is followed by watching the paper.

## 1. Process
### (1) Paper review
- After reviewing and summarizing the thesis, make a [PPT](https://github.com/young3984/3D_reconstruction_using_2D_cross_section/blob/master/PPT/Reconstruction.pdf).
### (2) Heat equation
- Approximating heat equations in an implicit method. [[Codes]](https://github.com/young3984/3D_reconstruction_using_2D_cross_section/tree/master/Code/Heat_equation)

- Approximating the above method using Gauss Seidel iteration.[[Codes]](https://github.com/young3984/3D_reconstruction_using_2D_cross_section/tree/master/Code/Heat_equation)

### (3) Reconstruct using the modified Khan Healyard equation.
